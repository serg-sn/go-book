In this example, we're organizing a superhero meetup and have a map of their secret identities.
We print out their secret identities, change them to protect the superheroes, add a new superhero to the meetup,
and check if we have the secret identity for an unknown superhero.
The comments in the code explain what's happening at each step.
Have fun with this superhero party! ðŸ¦¸
