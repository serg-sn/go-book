In this example, we're hosting a costume party with five guests.
We use an array to store the guests' costumes and assign a costume to each guest.
Then, we loop through the array and print out the costumes.
The comments in the code explain what's happening at each step.
I hope this example brings a smile to your face! ðŸŽƒ
